# openfoxwq

This repository contains my attempt to reverse engineer the [Fox Go Server](https://foxwq.com/) protocol and build a client that is usable in other platforms (at least Linux and OSX). The only native client available at the moment is for Windows and the mobile clients (Android and iOS), and they are not entirely localized although this is a lesser problem for most people.
